            Reverse-engineers APIs to generate integration scripts for platform automation.
            
            Tool Function Signature:
            def integuru_tool(har_path: str, cookie_path: str, prompt: str, model: str = "gpt-4o", input_variables: Optional[dict] = None) -> str
            
            Integuru identifies network requests from `.har` files, maps dependencies, and generates runnable Python code for interacting with platforms' internal APIs. It can handle dynamic parameters, authentication cookies, and 2FA workflows, creating integration scripts for complex workflows. This tool is useful for enabling the assistant to automate tasks on platforms without official APIs, such as downloading reports, performing repetitive actions, or interfacing with undocumented services, all in real time.
            
            Parameters:
            - har_path (str): Path to the .har file containing network requests.
            - cookie_path (str): Path to the JSON file with authentication cookies.
            - prompt (str): Action description for the code generation task.
            - model (str, optional): LLM model to use (default: gpt-4o).
            - input_variables (dict, optional): Dynamic input values for requests.
            
            Returns:
            A Python script as a string that performs the requested action using the platform's internal endpoints.
